<h1>Deploying Honeypot on Azure Virtual Machine with</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to facilitate the deployment of a Honeypot on a virtual machine hosted in the Azure cloud environment. The Honeypot will serve as a decoy system, designed to attract and identify potential cybersecurity threats and attack vectors, thus bolstering the overall security posture.

The project leverages Azure's infrastructure to create and manage the virtual machine, ensuring scalability and reliability. Connection to the virtual machine is established using Putty, a widely-used SSH client for Windows, enabling secure remote access and administration.

The Git repository contains detailed documentation and scripts for deploying the Honeypot, configuring the virtual machine. Additionally, it provides insights into monitoring and analyzing the captured data to gain valuable threat intelligence.

This project aims to gain hands-on experience in deploying and managing a Honeypot in a cloud environment, enhancing understanding of cybersecurity defense strategies and threat detection techniques.
